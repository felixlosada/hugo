Tab Rules</h2></center>
The following rules will be used in tabulating this tournament:
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pairing first round, seeds will be respected
with the following order of priority:&nbsp; full seeds, half seeds, and
one free seed per school.
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In subsequent rounds, pairings will be power-matched
among brackets (e.g., 1-0 teams hit 1-0 teams, 0-1 teams hit 0-1 teams),
and power-protected within brackets (e.g., the highest 1-0 hits the lowest
1-0, second highest hits second lowest, etc.).&nbsp; Total team speaker
points will be used to rank teams within brackets, with total team speaker
ranks used to break ties.
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a pull-up is necessary to complete a bracket,
the highest team in the upper bracket will hit the middle team in the next
lower bracket.
</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following constraints will be respected, in
descending order of priority:
</p><ul>
<li>
No team shall be pulled up or down more than one bracket.</li>

<li>
No team shall hit another team from its own school during in-rounds, unless
that school's teams fill more than one-half of a bracket.</li>

<li>
No two teams shall hit each other more than once during in-rounds.</li>

<li>
No team shall have more than three Gov rounds or more than three Opp rounds.</li>

<li>
No team shall be pulled up more than once.</li>

<li>
No team shall hit a pull-up more than once.</li>
</ul>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining the rankings of teams for purposes
of breaks and awards, we will use the following order of priority:&nbsp;
team record, total team speaks, total team ranks, head-to-head performance
(if any), adjusted total team speaks, adjusted total team ranks, double-adjusted
total team speaks, double-adjusted total team ranks, opposition strength,
coin flip.
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining the rankings of speakers for purposes
of awards, we will use the following order of priority:&nbsp; speaks, ranks,
adjusted speaks, adjusted ranks, double-adjusted speaks, double-adjusted
ranks, team performance (as addressed in rule 5 above), coin flip.
</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any out-round, the team that has been Gov in
the larger number of previous rounds (including both in-rounds and previous
out-rounds) will have the choice of sides.&nbsp; If both teams have had
an equal number of Gov rounds, sides will be decided by coin flip.
</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any disputes about rulings or other matters related
to tab should be addressed to the tab director, who will have final discretion.
