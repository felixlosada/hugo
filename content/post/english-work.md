Ah, *white*, *hispanic or latino* , *black or african-american* or *asian*.

The great generalisation of our generation. Some things come easy, and some things come hard. The United States' census has been silently dividing racial groups and conquering racially fuelled discussion. 
The American experiment has brought large and through change throughout every area of social culture, federal and governmental change. These beneficial ammendments to the systems that fuel one the richest and most powerful countries on this earth have positively - yet negatively - affected the general masses worldwide. 

The census divides racial groups into the following. 
* White alone, non-Hispanic
* Hispanic or Latino
* Black or African-American alone, non-Hispanic
* Asian alone, non-Hispanic

These general groups divide race, divide culture. Some people may mind more than others, yet it has been food for thought.
